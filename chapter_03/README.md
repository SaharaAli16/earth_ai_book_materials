# AI for Sea Ice Forecasting

## Introduction
In this chapter we present an in-depth tutorial covering some of the applications of Artificial Intelligence for forecasting Arctic Sea Ice. The tutorial will walk you through some of the previous and newly developed data-driven models for Sea Ice Forecasting:
1. Multiple Linear Regression to forecast Arctic Sea Ice Extent.
2. Long Short Term Memory Model for one month ahead Time-series forecasting.
3. Deep Learning Ensemble for forecasting monthly Arctic Sea Ice Extent.

This repository includes: 
1. Data (dataset for running the models)
2. Code (notebooks for all three models)
